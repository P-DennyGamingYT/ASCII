# ASCII

A video to ASCII converter written in HTML.

# How to use

Using ASCII is easy, just go to the [website](https://p-dennygamingyt.github.io/ASCII/), then when prompted to use your camera click yes, then you should see an ASCII output on your screen!

# More to come

There are a few more features I would like to add to this project, such as a home page, making it a desktop application, text to ASCII, and a .mp4/.mov to ASCII option.
